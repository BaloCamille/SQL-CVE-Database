# SQL-Final-CVE-Project

Database Programming I Class Final

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to create a basic database of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) that can be queried to extract useful information. CVEs are assigned to publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and maintaining an up-to-date and accurate CVE database is critical for organizations to mitigate cybersecurity risks. After designing and creating the database, CVEs and related information will be populated in the database (manually obtained from MITRE), and meaningful queries will be run to pull valuable data.<br>




**Files Included:**<br>
+SQL CVE Data Dictionary--contains information on the structure of each column in each table<br>
+CVE ERD--contains the ERD for the database<br>
+create_insert_cve.sql--contains the table creation and data insertion for the database<br>
+cve_queries.sql--contains 10 queries for the database<br>
+SQL CVE Queries and Results--contains the queries and screenshots of the results<br>
+sql cve final presentation--contains the presentatio slides for the project<br>
